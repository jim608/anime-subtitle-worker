# Incremental Delivery Plan

## M0 — Baseline and low-I/O ingestion

- [x] Audit current Watcher, task creation, stages, temporary/final outputs, error paths, Docker and configuration.
- [x] Record focused regression baseline.
- [x] Identify recursive disk-I/O sources.
- [x] Make filesystem events the normal ingestion authority.
- [x] Persist discovery/stability observations across restart.
- [x] Reject temporary/incomplete files and require a write-complete gate.
- [x] Keep startup reconciliation and low-frequency bounded fallback only.
- [x] Stop idle AI and Mikan loops from repeatedly walking the whole library.

## M1 — Durable resumable pipeline state

- [x] Add stable Job/media revision identity to the existing WAL SQLite store.
- [x] Enforce the documented states and auditable transitions.
- [x] Persist per-stage attempts, inputs, outputs, model, timeout, retry and checkpoint.
- [x] Recover interrupted work from the last valid checkpoint.
- [x] Preserve existing queue/WebUI and subtitle pipeline compatibility.
- [x] Keep source video immutable and publish verified staged outputs atomically.
- [x] Pass all M1 acceptance and focused regression tests.
- [x] Complete architecture, design, state-machine, recovery and test-result documents.

M0/M1 implementation and acceptance are complete locally. These checkboxes do not claim an UNRAID deployment, the 100-input release gate, the rolling-500 Production SLO, or a measured 99%/99.9% autonomy rate.

M2 translation quality, Translation Memory, full QC redesign and WebUI work are explicitly out of scope until every M0/M1 checkbox is complete.
