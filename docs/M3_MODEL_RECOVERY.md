# M3 — configured model recovery

M3 is authorized and active. M2 production acceptance remains incomplete;
its frozen cohort, held sources and UNPROVEN preservation claims are unchanged.

## Scope

Build on the existing ASR/translation entry points, model configuration,
resource admission and persistent stage/checkpoint stores. Do not create a
parallel queue or lower output QC to make a fallback appear successful.
Model discovery is evidence of availability, not authorization to use unrelated
models. Model route attempts and their failure/recovery reasons must be bounded
and attributable to the actual processing runtime.

## Initial verified change

The existing translator resolver substituted any sole advertised model for a
missing configured model. It could also collapse primary/fallback into just the
advertised fallback. Two new regressions reproduced both failures on the server
in a read-only candidate mount, without production data or network access.

The implicit sole-model substitution is removed. Configured routes remain in
order when discovery lacks the primary; the existing request failure path then
advances only through that configured chain. Existing unique alias matching is
retained for compatibility and still needs an explicit M3 authorization contract.
This first change does not claim the entire model adapter design is finished.

- Baseline: 118 tests PASS.
- New failing regressions: 2 expected failures before the fix.
- After fix: 121 resource admission/runtime/Worker integration, translator and
  translation checkpoint tests PASS, including composed discovery-to-request
  rejection of the unapproved model and bounded configured-chain exhaustion.
- Server logs: `/logs/m3-baseline-20260908T070237Z/` (`tests.log`,
  `model-route-before.log`, `model-route-after.log`).
- Production runtime/configuration not changed by these isolated tests.

## Remaining engineering and acceptance

- Explicit compatible alias/route identity and durable route-attempt evidence.
- Verify failure-budget persistence when failure occurs before a completed batch:
  current translation checkpoint writes follow successful batches and restore
  `last_model` only alongside completed batches.
- Verify timeout cancellation versus overlapping requests: the current hard
  timeout calls `future.cancel()` then shuts down its executor without waiting;
  a started request may still be running. Establish a bounded single-in-flight
  contract with existing resource/lease mechanisms before changing behavior.
- Exercise crash/OOM, timeout, exhausted fallback, missing resources and restart,
  keeping valid checkpoints and source/valid-output safety intact.
- Actual-image integration, safe deployment/controlled Gate handoff and bounded
  live evidence remain required. No production completion or M3 acceptance yet.
